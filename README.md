Analysis of purchase data from a gaming app called Heroes of Pymoli
Python code was used to find the breakdown of users of the game by gender and age groups to see which group of users use the game the most and also which spend the most money/make the most purchases in the game.

The items in the game were also looked at to determine which items were the most profitable as well as which items were purchased the most often.
